<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> How to</h1>
<p>There are multiple ways to navigate <em>Spreadsheets!</em></p>
<p>You can follow the narrative and click the <span style="margin: 1px; padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px; text-transform: uppercase; background-color:#f0f0f0; border-radius:15px; border-right:2px solid #c2c2c2; padding:5px 10px; font-size: .8em;text-align: center; color: $linkColor; font-family: $font-family-sans-serif; width: 120px; display: inline-block">next cell</span> buttons on the bottom right of each page to go to the next cell in the story.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use arrows <code>˂˄⌄˃</code> (either the ones on your keyboard or the ones on the edges of each cell) to meander around the grid as you please. To get a bird’s-eye view of the grid, hit the letter <code>o</code> or your <code>escape</code> key (also good if you just need a break from reading). Hitting <code>o</code> or your <code>escape</code> key again will zoom you back into a particular cell.</p>
<p>If none of the above works for you, there is also a table of contents, accessible at the bottom left of the screen. If you get lost, use your browser’s back button to return to your most recently visited cell.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a cell might have a large image or block of text on it; if you can’t see all of the content, try scrolling. To search through the project, use the shortcut <code>shift + ctrl + f</code>.</p>
</section>

<section>
<section id="spreadsheet-gallery" class="title-slide slide level1 center" data-number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Spreadsheet gallery</h1>
<p>Travel downwards <code>⌄</code> to explore a gallery of spreadsheets and ask yourself “is this a spreadsheet?” Or, head to the right <code>˃</code> to start the narrative. Alternatively, you can start with the <a href="intro.html">separate introduction</a> (though it might be better to do that afterwards).</p>

<p>Though there were what we would recognize as spreadsheets on mainframe computers in the 1960s (and incidentally, the comma-separated values file format also dates from that decade), the story of the electronic spreadsheet as we know it today typically starts in 1979 with the program <strong>Visicalc</strong>.</p>
<p>The familiar tale goes like this: former computer programmer Dan Bricklin had switched gears and was studying for an MBA at Harvard. He was frustrated with having to do business calculations by hand, since one mistake meant lots of erasing. As he told the hosts of NPR’s Planet Money in <span class="citation" data-cites="jacob_goldstein_episode_2015"><span>“Episode 606: <span>Spreadsheets</span>!”</span> (<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2015</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought that, you know, it’s kind of silly that we’re writing on this blackboard, where I can’t - if only we had a blackboard where I could erase a number and write a new number in and everything would recalculate.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Personal computing and the spreadsheet wars</h2>
<p>Many have noted that Visicalc, which was somewhat by chance written for the Apple II, is what launched the personal computer boom of the 1980s. Bricklin and his business partner Bob Frankston have even been called the Watson and Crick of the personal computer industry <span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_origins_2003">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick=""><span>“The <span>Origins</span> and <span>Impact</span> of <span>VisiCalc</span>, Lecture by <span>Dan</span> <span>Bricklin</span> Et Al.”</span> 2003, 10:10</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, spreadsheet products proliferated, with software like Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel dominating during different periods while, as Martin Campbell-Kelly put it, “there were dozens of what the trade press termed ‘Other Calcs’, ‘Visi-Clones’, or ‘Calcalikes’” <span class="citation" data-cites="campbell-kelly_rise_2003">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Campbell-Kelly 2003</a>, p 330)</span>. This phenomenon has also been termed the <strong>“Spreadsheet Wars.”</strong></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Spreadsheet software features</h2>
<p>Visicalc set some of the basic features we still see today: it linked cells together with both absolute and relative references, used alphanumeric notation to refer to columns and rows (like A1), and it included familiar functions like <code>SUM()</code>, <code>AVERAGE()</code>, and <code>LOOKUP()</code>.</p>
<p>As spreadsheet products developed and companies competed with one another in the ’80s and ’90s, complex features were incorporated. For example, with Excel, we see a move away from Visicalc and Lotus 1-2-3’s paradigm of keyboard commands and shortcuts (a character-based interface) toward drop-down menus (a graphical user interface).</p>
<p>Other features included things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>replacing cell coordinates with natural language names for cells or groups of cells</li>
<li>database integration</li>
<li>linking multiple sheets</li>
<li>more and more graphical charts that would be updated when changes were made to the associated worksheet</li>

<p>Some of the innovations of the ’80s and early ’90s didn’t stick, like making formulas with natural language references by default rather than relying on cell references (although you can name ranges in Excel and Google Sheets). While some might say the spreadsheet is largely unchanged since its explosion on the scene in the ’80s, as personal computers and their hardware and software interfaces changed and developed, so, too, did spreadsheet software programs. Today, while Excel has maintained dominance in the market and in cultural references, products like Google Sheets and open source LibreOffice are also used. Google Sheets in particular takes spreadsheets in another direction by combining spreadsheet software and cloud-based, synchronous and asynchronous collaborative editing capabilities.</p>

<p>One thing that might surprise you about <em>electronic</em> spreadsheets is how much they have to do with paper. Advertisements and segments from the <em>Computer Chronicles</em> show that spreadsheets were often meant to be printed out on physical pieces of paper. Even back in the time of mainframe spreadsheets, preparing and formatting reports was a key purpose of the programs: as Martin Campbell-Kelly <span class="citation" data-cites="campbell-kelly_rise_2003">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2003, 326</a>)</span> quotes from a Basic Business Language manual,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of the most useful applications of BBL is for report generation: preparing and formatting reports. Reports of this type, sometimes called spread sheets, are often used to summarize historic information or forecast future performance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, incidentally, may be one of the first times the term “spreadsheet” was used to refer to the electronic spreadsheet.</p>

<p>The distinction between spreadsheet and database, and even the line that spreadsheet product X goes beyond the bounds of the “normal” spreadsheet, is a familiar refrain, seen in a 1988 Oracle ad that reads <em>“Spreadsheet growing too big and complex? You need a database.”</em> The refrain of “this is not a spreadsheet” echoes still: today, subscription products like Airtable and Monday.com provide interfaces that draw heavily on the appearance of the spreadsheet and hinge on the underlying structure of the grid. However, while they look like spreadsheet software interfaces on the surface, Airtable is running a lightweight relational database underneath. In advertisements, these products seek to differentiate themselves from spreadsheets.</p>

<p>As shown in the previous section, <strong>Spreadsheet origins</strong>, spreadsheets are software programs and can be traced through the histories of personal computing, product development, and the rise, fall, and dominance of software companies. As Hendry and Green <span class="citation" data-cites="hendry_creating_1994">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">1994</a>)</span> remark, the literature about spreadsheets in the 80s and 90s seemed “bedazzled” by the success of the software.</p>
<p>But this is just one angle on the story. Though we get glimpses of why and how spreadsheets have been used, there is more to uncover. While you can probably look at a spreadsheet and recognize it as such, it’s worth dissecting what shifting assemblages of things and processes are understood as a spreadsheet. Zooming out to look at the material and artifactual qualities of spreadsheets starts to uncover underlying logics and qualities of that which we call “spreadsheet.”</p>
<p>Studying spreadsheets this way begins to explain why spreadsheets are put to such myriad uses: depending on the situation, a spreadsheet user might activate different combinations of these core qualities.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Grid</h2>
<p>For Paul Dourish, the grid-forward spreadsheet exemplifies the spreadsheet as digital document. He argues that one of the central organizational devices or features of the spreadsheet is the grid, and that one of the key reasons users may adopt a spreadsheet is “specifically because the layout structure matches needs for lists, tables, and data collections” <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 89</a>)</span>.</p>

<img data-src="assets/CES-data.png" class="r-stretch quarto-figure-center"><p class="caption">Spreadsheet from Alex’s friend’s dissertation research on non-material relationships with nature, showing codes for 300 interviews and each participant’s demographic data</p><p>Dourish says a consequence of the grid structure (as opposed to a non-grid-based database structure or a word processor’s blank document) is that the granularity of the data is set at the level of the cell (although it is worth noting that in practice, multiple data points may be squished into a single cell).</p>
<p>An extreme counter example might help: retired businessman-turned-artist Tatsuo Horiuchi <a href="#/the-michelangelo-of-microsoft-excel">uses Microsoft Excel to create “paintings,”</a> but they do <em>not</em> make use of the grid. Rather, he uses the line and shape tools to make (impressively detailed) landscapes and still lifes.</p>
<p>Would you call this a spreadsheet? Likely not. While the works use a spreadsheet program, the result does not seem like one without the grid.</p>

<p>María Matienzo <span class="citation" data-cites="matienzo_ever_2016">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2016</a>)</span> notes that “Specifically, the visual constraint of the spreadsheet’s tabular format for data and formulas allows users a clearer understanding of how to complete their work at hand,” quoting Visicalc developer Bob Frankston on the importance of the grid as constraint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anything, the big break with the VisiCalc was the grid that actually reduced the amount of interactivity. The original design was much more flexible and powerful. The key was the grid, which gave you a framework for reference and simplified everything. It’s almost the opposite of what people think—people think that more features make a design easier. It’s actually a reduction in features that make it feasible. Later, as people became used to it, you could add features, but the basic idea was reducing the grid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Dourish, “[a] spreadsheet starts not blank but empty” <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 90</a>)</span>; it is an anticipatory pattern that “does not simply hold information – it also shows where more information would go” <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 91</a>)</span>. In Lisa Gitelman’s <em>Paper Knowledge</em>, blank books are described as a meta-microgenre of document that create “parameters or the rules for entries to be made individually in pencil or ink.”<span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman_paper_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Gitelman 2014, 23</a>)</span> The concept of controlling or providing “rules” for entry of information also applies to the spreadsheet. Unlike blank books, in which layouts would have been fixed by the job printer, spreadsheet architecture is determined by the spreadsheet designer. However, the tabular structure of rows and columns remains an underlying constraint of the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>For Dourish, the grid layout and the unit of the cell ties into Lisa Gitelman’s thesis in the introduction to <em>Raw Data is an Oxymoron</em>, in that it “demonstrate[s] commitments to particular plans of action or modes of analysis” <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 90</a>)</span>, which is important because spreadsheets are seen as a medium of purportedly neutral data sharing, when in fact they aren’t: the grid, the table, the database – all prescribe a particular framework, and demonstrate a point of view.</p>

<p>Following Lisa Gitelman’s elucidation of the document as genre in her book <em>Paper Knowledge</em>, the spreadsheet can be looked at as a subgenre of the document genre as she defines it.</p>
<p>Gitelman identifies the core function of documents as “the know-show function, since documenting is an epistemic practice: the kind of knowing that is all wrapped up with showing, and showing wrapped with knowing.” <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman_paper_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Gitelman 2014, 1</a>)</span></p>
<p>We see this in action in spreadsheets through their features for formatting and presenting information graphically, and the fact that they are often shared in bureaucratic and corporate settings. As shown in the previous section, spreadsheets were often formatted specifically for printing on paper or with paper in mind – a fact among many which gestures toward their document-ness.</p>

<p>The two-dimensionality of the grid speaks to the spreadsheet’s emphasis on the visual and the act of making visible through organization. A table is itself can be considered a form of data visualization.</p>

<p>Beyond the table itself being a visual form, spreadsheet software has numerous features for adding what Hendry and Green <span class="citation" data-cites="hendry_creating_1994">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">1994</a>)</span> called “typographical sugar”: fonts, colors, lines, charts, and more. In part, this emphasis on graphics and graphical aspects ties into the role of spreadsheets as documents to be printed and/or shared – documents to be understood by human eyes rather than processed by a computer. The formatting features of spreadsheets are taken to extremes by contemporary artists and activists in examples that seem to stray far from the data- or number-intensive use of spreadsheets. In these works, the grid is a jumping-off point for explorations of color, shape, and pattern.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Data tables</h2>
<p>Closely tied to the grid is another variety of spreadsheet: the data table. List-like, inventories and scientific measurement data are often collected in tabular form. There is a subtle distinction between the collection of data, its presentation, and its analysis, and sometimes a tabular data-focused spreadsheet might do all at once. In other cases, data might be collected or stored in a spreadsheet or tabular file, but fed into an analysis program like Stata or a script written in R or another programming language.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Tabular data formats</h2>
<p>In addition to application-specific file formats like <code>.xls</code> or <code>.xlsx</code> (both formats for Excel) or Visicalc’s Data Interchange Format (DIF), spreadsheets can be stored in tabular file formats, like comma-separated values (CSV) or its cousin, tab separated values (TSV). Examples of “flat file” formats, these delimiter-separated files represent “a rectangular array (matrix) of numeric and textual values.” <span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_csv_2020">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick=""><span>“<span>CSV</span>, <span>Comma</span> <span>Separated</span> <span>Values</span> (<span>RFC</span> 4180)”</span> 2020</a>)</span></p>
<p>The CSV format pre-dates Visicalc and the personal computer electronic spreadsheet. As Alex Rasmussen <span class="citation" data-cites="rasmussen_its_2021">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2021</a>)</span> recounts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the CSV format itself dates at least as far back as the early 1970s. Tired of having to manually align their input data to punch-cards’ columns, FORTRAN users quickly embraced “list-directed input/output”, a format in which (according to the FORTRAN IV manual for VM/370) “input entries are specified by blanks or commas, with successive commas indicating values to be omitted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most appealing aspects of open tabular data formats like CSV and TSV is that most computer programs and people can read them. Rasmussen summarizes: “While many programs can’t read or write Excel spreadsheets, almost anything can read and write CSVs, and a human can open a CSV file in any text editor and understand roughly what it contains” <span class="citation" data-cites="rasmussen_its_2021">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Rasmussen 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.11</span> Interacting with data</h2>
<p>Data from a relational database can be exported in tabular or CSV format (essential when data must be exchanged between relational databases of different flavors, whose file formats are incompatible). That data can, and often is, then opened in a spreadsheet program. Tabular data thus flows into and out of databases and sometimes lands in a spreadsheet program.</p>
<p>Though “flat file” spreadsheets are distinguished from databases in a technical sense, Lev Manovich’s definition in “Database as Symbolic Form” is broad enough to encompass them. For Manovich, the database is defined loosely as “a collection of items on which the user can perform various operations: view, navigate, and search” <span class="citation" data-cites="victoria_vesna_editor_database_2007">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Manovich 2007, 39</a>)</span>, examples of which include virtual museums on CD-ROMS and HTML pages.</p>
<p>Though Dourish observes, “Databases are not objects of direct user attention in quite the same way as spreadsheets” <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 105</a>)</span>, spreadsheet programs are used to gather/create, structure, exchange, find, sort, and view/visualize data. Through the combination of data and interface, spreadsheets allow users to perform the kinds of operations Manovich outlines. Perhaps spreadsheet software interfaces are a way people can interact with databases-as-datasets (in Dourish’s first, more broad sense of the word “database.”)</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.12</span> Dataset-database</h2>
<p>A spreadsheet is not a database…or is it?</p>
<p>In his chapter on No SQL, Dourish observes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term database is often used ambiguously….in the technical domain too, where the term has different uses at different times. Purely within that domain, we can distinguish between three levels at which the term is sometimes used. <strong>The first level is simply a collection of data.</strong> In informal parlance, the term database is sometimes used simply to denote the amassing of data or information, perhaps synonymously with data set <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 107</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Technically</em>, of course, a spreadsheet is not a database (relational, hierarchical, graph, or otherwise). But sometimes people <em>call</em> them databases, or even structure them in a way vaguely reminiscent of linked relational tables.</p>
<p>As Dourish writes, “Relational databases model their data in tabular form. Like a row in a printed table, a single entry in a table describes a relation among items of data” <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 115</a>)</span>. Though they are not one in the same, tabular data underlies both the spreadsheet and the relational database.</p>
<p>A spreadsheet might structure a list as a gridded table like one you might find in a relational database, with rows representing items and columns defining attributes to be recorded about those items. Data may be pulled into a spreadsheet from a database, even, from database as data source into a matrix of calculations and formulas. Spreadsheets can also replicate some of the linking of a relational database, in a crude way: in a workbook, for example, sheets may be linked together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The grid exists to serve the formula; the grid provides a way of naming cells, using a coordinate mechanism so that a formula can link cells together. The formula captures both ideas that were central to Bricklin’s original conception—automated calculation and exploration depend on formulae that will calculate results and outcomes based on figures the user enters. <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 87</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bricklin’s anecdote about Visicalc’s origins being born out of the need to quickly see changes to calculations encapsulates a central aspect of electronic spreadsheets for both mainframes and personal computers: their ability to facilitate <strong>what-if</strong> analyses, where changing one number in a budget, for example, cascades changes to other cells and allows the user to immediately compare scenarios. The ability to use formulas and ask “what if” is one of the core qualities of spreadsheets.</p>

For Dourish, the difference between content and dynamic formulas can be illustrated by comparing how a spreadsheet of direct number objects compares to one with derived objects: while visually they look the same in the spreadsheet program interface, in the spreadsheet with the formula, “the number 10 does not itself necessarily appear.” <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 94</a>)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only way to search for it is within the framework of the calculation engine itself—so one can load the spreadsheet and search for the number, but one cannot search, Google-like, over a variety of spreadsheets to find the one with the 10 in it. Further, how should we think about the fixity of the 10 in the spreadsheet? On the one hand, it is utterly ephemeral—never stored, calculated again every time the document is loaded or processed, disappearing once more when the document is saved or unloaded or the application window closed. On the other, it is exactly as stable as the 1, the 2, the 3, and the 4, since it is generated from them; as long as they remain the same, so too does the 10 <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 96</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>As Nick Montfort writes in his introduction to Ben Shniederman’s 1983 article “Direct Manipulation: A Step Beyond Programming Languages” (reprinted in the NewMedia Reader), with direct manipulation, “instead of employing a command language to instruct the computer, the data being processed is exposed and accessed in a more graphically representational way, and immediate visual feedback is provided after every action” <span class="citation" data-cites="wardrip-fruin_newmediareader_2003">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Wardrip-Fruin and Montfort 2003, 485</a>)</span>.</p>

In his book and exhibition <em>The Interface Experience</em>, Kimon Keramidas presents a more holistic understanding of interface that includes hardware, software, and humans. Following Brenda Laurel’s characterization of an interface as a contact surface, Keramidas <span class="citation" data-cites="keramidas_interface_2015">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2015, 16</a>)</span> suggests that “if the interface is a contact surface, then it can be argued that it is the place where the physical interaction between the user and the computer is materially constituted.” For Keramidas,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interface as materially constituted is therefore the result of the physical conjoining of both human and machine, consisting in toto and simultaneously of the brain as thought producer, the body as action executor, the input device as interaction receiver, the processor as input translator, the software as feedback generator, and the screen as feedback provider <span class="citation" data-cites="keramidas_interface_2015">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Keramidas, Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, and Material Culture 2015, 16</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This broader view of interface is helpful for understanding spreadsheets. If you think about it, the bodily experience of using an early spreadsheet was vastly different from the experience most users have today: while now many people manipulate a mouse, Visicalc or Lotus 1-2-3 users would have primarily or exclusively used the keyboard. Macros are a throughline of experience from early spreadsheets to contemporary ones: today’s spreadsheet power-users often rely on keyboard commands for shortcuts and to activate macros.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> End-user programming</h2>
<p>In Nardi and Miller’s 1991 study, the subjects interviewed disrupt the assumption of an “end-user/developer pair”: the non-programmer (and domain expert on the content) is able to do the bulk of the design and structure work in the spreadsheet <span class="citation" data-cites="nardi_twinkling_1991">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Nardi and Miller 1991</a>)</span>. One aspect of spreadsheets that seems to diverge from other programming languages and environments is that discretionary end-users slip into the role of programmer or developer. Wendy Chun points out that generally speaking, “programmers are users: they create programs using editors, which are themselves software programs” <span class="citation" data-cites="chun_software_2005">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Chun 2005, 38</a>)</span>. Felienne Hermans and Emerson Murphy-Hill observe: “in many ways, developing a spreadsheet is similar to writing code. Both entail analyzing data, manipulating operations on that data and understanding dependencies between different parts of the program” <span class="citation" data-cites="hermans_enrons_2015-1">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Hermans and Murphy-Hill 2015, 7</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A central aspect of spreadsheets is therefore that they allow people who don’t think they are programmers to accomplish programming tasks. María Matienzo concludes that “the power of VisiCalc, and arguably spreadsheets overall, then is this fundamental tension, wherein programming is both perceived to be both fundamentally accessible and simultaneously unnecessary to leverage the potential of the technology” <span class="citation" data-cites="matienzo_ever_2016">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Matienzo 2016</a>)</span>. Discussing a paper Bob Frankston wrote and an anecdote related by Dan Bricklin, she writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frankston realized that “VisiCalc made everyone a programmer.” Similarly, Bricklin cites Jean-Louis Gassée’s description of his encounter with VisiCalc: “That was the day I realized that you didn’t have to be a programmer any more to use a computer. … Approximations, trial and error, simulations – Visicalc is an intellectual modeling clay. It lets you program without knowing it” <span class="citation" data-cites="matienzo_ever_2016">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Matienzo 2016</a>)</span></p>

Computers as Theatre. 2nd edition.</p><p>Brenda Laurel discusses how plot and dramatic action have shapes, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#Freytag's_pyramid">Freytag curve</a>, and suggests such shapes be applied to mundane human-computer interactions such as the use of a spreadsheet. She visualizes a spreadsheet interaction (creating and adjusting a budget and seeing the effects of changing numbers) using a more modern version of the classic Freytag pyramid, arguing that her example “shows the way in which the application and the person collaborate to create a whole action with an interesting shape” <span class="citation" data-cites="laurel_computers_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Laurel 2014</a>, ch.&nbsp;3)</span>.</p>
<p>While her example focuses on the typical budget spreadsheet scenario, her framework could apply to other types of spreadsheets such as those falling into the inventory tradition.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.8</span> Spreadsheets as conversation and event</h2>
<p>Sometimes, spreadsheets spark conversation. As Paul Dourish writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spreadsheet…is also an organizational tool, not just in the way it is incorporated into organizational processes such as financial planning, but also in the way in it is incorporated into the practice and routines of organizations life, such as meetings <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 82</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hendry and Green found that it can be difficult to map a spreadsheet’s cell references to meaningful concepts in the domain modelled by the spreadsheet. They noted that <em>explanation</em> of spreadsheets also seemed to reside outside of the spreadsheet itself and take place in interactions between colleagues or collaborators.</p>
<p>Dourish describes what he calls <strong>“spreadsheet events,”</strong> inspired by Herbert Knoblauch’s idea of “powerpoint events.” In Dourish’s example, during a meeting a spreadsheet is used to keep track of work on a project and is projected onto the screen, while participants also have printed copies or the spreadsheet open on their laptops.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the meeting progresses, the grid of the spreadsheet is gradually filled in; tentative proposals become documented decisions, and the colors, formats, and markings of the spreadsheet indicate the progress that has been made. At the end of the meeting, this same coordinative artifact becomes an archive of the event, emailed around the organization or stored on a network server <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 81–82</a>)</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.10</span> Theatrical experience</h2>
<p>One way to understand the experience of interacting with software, including spreadsheet programs, is through the framework of theatre. In her book <em>Computers as Theatre</em>, Brenda Laurel frames computers and software programs in terms of Aristotle’s “four causes” in theatre: formal, material, efficient, and end causes.</p>
<p>For Laurel, the theatrical formal cause is a “whole action—with a beginning, middle, and end—that the playwright is trying to represent” <span class="citation" data-cites="laurel_computers_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Laurel 2014</a>, ch.&nbsp;2)</span>. In human-computer interaction (HCI), it is “a representation of action with agents that may be either human, computer-based, or a combination of both” <span class="citation" data-cites="laurel_computers_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Laurel 2014</a>, ch.&nbsp;2)</span>. The material cause is the sensory element (sights and sounds). While efficient cause in theatre encompasses the “skills, tools, and techniques of the playwright, actors, and other artists who contribute to the finished play” <span class="citation" data-cites="laurel_computers_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Laurel 2014</a>, ch.&nbsp;2)</span>, in the case of HCI, it also includes the agent interacting with the software. For Laurel, the end cause in theatre is catharsis: in HCI, catharsis encompasses both functionality (what the play or program is meant to do in the world) and also the experience of using the software and achieving a given outcome.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.11</span> Collaborative development</h2>
<p>In addition to identifying a disruption of the distinction between end user and developer, Nardi and Miller came out with two other unexpected insights: “spreadsheet co-development is the rule, not the exception” and “spreadsheets support the sharing of both programming and domain expertise” <span class="citation" data-cites="nardi_twinkling_1991">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Nardi and Miller 1991, 163</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Nardi and Miller use the term “cognitive artifact,” which comes from the field of human-computer interaction, to refer to spreadsheets. The definition of a cognitive artifact, put forth by Don Norman, is explained in the Glossary of Interaction Design as “man-made things that seem to aid or enhance our cognitive abilities” <span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_cognitive_nodate">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick=""><em>Cognitive <span>Artifacts</span></em> n.d.</a>)</span>. Nardi and Miller argue that spreadsheets “can be understood and shared by a group of people, providing a point of cognitive contact that mediates cooperative work” <span class="citation" data-cites="nardi_twinkling_1991">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Nardi and Miller 1991, 161</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As Matienzo notes, “Nardi and Miller view spreadsheets as an excellent medium for supporting such co-development, as they serve as a conduit for communication” <span class="citation" data-cites="matienzo_ever_2016">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Matienzo 2016</a>)</span>. For Matienzo,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this “bridging” function across levels and areas of domain knowledge is incredibly important, in that it improves the potential for dialog around the work at hand, and such co-development can allow for sustained collaboration in the longer term, allowing trust to be built across disparate teams <span class="citation" data-cites="matienzo_ever_2016">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Matienzo 2016</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Defining spreadsheets</h2>
<p>Let’s step back a moment and look at how spreadsheets are defined in the literature about them.</p>
<p>Across texts, the term “spreadsheet” becomes fuzzy: the literature, which spans disciplines, boasts a variety of definitions. Thomas Grossman and Özgür Özlük narrowly define the spreadsheet as “a visual computer implementation of a mathematical model” <span class="citation" data-cites="grossman_paradigm_2004">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Grossman and Özlük 2004, 4</a>)</span>. Bonnie Nardi and James Miller focus on spreadsheets as programs, calling them “spreadsheet applications” <span class="citation" data-cites="nardi_twinkling_1991">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Nardi and Miller 1991, 161</a>)</span>. Karl Broman and Kara Woo characterize spreadsheets as “widely used software tools for data entry, storage, analysis, and visualization” <span class="citation" data-cites="broman_data_2018">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Broman and Woo 2018, 2</a>)</span>. Liang Xu, Wensheng Dou, Jiaxin Zhu, Chushu Gao, Jun Wei, and Tao Huang <span class="citation" data-cites="xu_how_2018">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2018</a>)</span> also discuss spreadsheet programs, but deal on the object/artifact level and distinguish between the single worksheet and collection of worksheets (which is referred to as a spreadsheet). In their paper “Detecting and visualizing inter-worksheet smells in spreadsheets,” Felienne Hermans, Martin Pinzger, and Arie van Dursen <span class="citation" data-cites="hermans_detecting_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2012</a>)</span> also distinguish between worksheets and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>For María Matienzo, “[a] spreadsheet is a file with a specific form, which represents data in a tabular format, and within which formulas can be applied to that data” <span class="citation" data-cites="matienzo_ever_2016">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Matienzo 2016</a>)</span>. For Matienzo, tabular data on its own does not constitute a spreadsheet; it must be loaded into a software environment that provides spreadsheet functionality. It is “the unification of tabularly expressed information and formulas” <span class="citation" data-cites="matienzo_ever_2016">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Matienzo 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In his book chapter “Spreadsheets and Spreadsheet Events in Organizational Life,” Paul Dourish understands spreadsheets as both “interactive tools and representational systems” <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 84</a>)</span>.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Spreadsheet contexts: business and personal</h1>
<p>To really get at the question of spreadsheet use, it is not enough to examine the material and artifactual qualities of spreadsheets or generalize about their interactive and cooperative uses on an abstract level. Instead, we must try to explore their contexts of use and the connotations of those contexts.</p>
<p>A thread through the story of the spreadsheet, both paper-based and electronic, is the context of business and number-crunching. One entrenched idea is that spreadsheets are for budgets, profit and loss statements, and financial models for businesses or the stock market. It’s actually not unreasonable at all to think this; the association is borne out in the paper-based antecedents of electronic spreadsheets and in spreadsheet humor.</p>
<p>By looking at the bigger context, we can complicate dominant narratives – namely, that spreadsheets are used in corporate settings for budget or financial tasks – by revealing examples that show other kinds of uses (for example, as media of data exchange and list-making, tools for management of personal tasks, sites of creative and social play, and media for cooperation and communication).</p>
<p>With this expanded picture, we can ask questions like “what does it mean or imply to bring a tool like the spreadsheet, with its particular corporate finance connotations, into other spheres of bureaucratic and personal activity?”</p>

In Apple’s “Get a Mac” ad campaign of the early 2000s, which pitted characters representing a Mac and a Microsoft PC, respectively, Excel is part of the PC character’s identity, who is framed squarely as a nerdy, office worker-type played by John Hodgman. “You should see what this guy can do with a spreadsheet, it’s insane” Justin Long’s Mac character says in the ad “Better.” In contrast, Mac presents himself as all about fun stuff, like vacations – in other words, the things that happen outside of work.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.6</span> Ledgers and accounting</h2>
<p>In her book on the grid, art historian Hannah Higgins traces the development of ledgers and budgets through to the electronic spreadsheet. Higgins begins her history of the ledger with Greek and Roman account books, medieval tallies (boards or notched sticks) and checkerboard abacuses, eventually tracing the origins of the double entry ledger to 12th century Genova, with a key example coming from 1211 in Florence (the first banker’s ledger). These ledgers involved third party verification and tracking not just of end total, but of “movement of capital over time” <span class="citation" data-cites="higgins_grid_2009">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Higgins 2009, 132</a>)</span>. This practice was codified in Paciolo’s “Account Keeping” chapter in the textbook <em>Suma de Arithmetica</em>. In 1795, Edmond Degrange created a system that “merges daily entries, merchandise accounts, cash, bills receivable, profits, and balance all in one place, on paper roughly twice the width of normal paper sheets (hence “spreadsheets”).” <span class="citation" data-cites="higgins_grid_2009">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Higgins 2009, 140</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The methodical, detached nature of spreadsheets is played up as incongruous with the personal and relationships in a March 30, 1995 Dilbert cartoon, in which Liz and Dilbert get into an exchange when Liz creates a spreadsheet to analyze their romantic compatability. “I’m afraid I’m twenty percent too good for you. We must stop dating,” she says. Part of the humor here is again the displacement of the use of a work product and technique for a personal purpose.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Imposing business and political interests</h2>
<p>In addition to flexing bureaucratic power as inventories and lists of description, spreadsheets have been a medium for imposing political and business interests from one bureaucracy to another.</p>
<p>In her article “The Official Response is Never Enough,” Kera Allen details how “seemingly rational technical solutions can be imbued with different political interests, and how the outcomes of these solutions can have antagonistic results” <span class="citation" data-cites="allen_official_2019">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Allen 2019, 35</a>)</span>. Allen’s case study is about the Rockefeller Foundation’s decision to ship two Apple II computers pre-loaded with Visicalc to the Tunisian Ministry of Culture in order to speed up the agency’s work and manage its grain shortage crisis.</p>
<p>The problem seemed to be the exact one Visicalc was designed for: replacing manual calculation and facilitating what-if analysis. However, Tunisia’s crop production was not made sustainable and in 1984, violent bread riots erupted. Allen writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the riots, the Rockefeller Foundation viewed VisiCalc as a success. Use of the application itself was a measure of increased analytical capacity where data produced using the software indicated favorable results, regardless of the projected crop outcomes and government response to those projections <span class="citation" data-cites="allen_official_2019">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Allen 2019, 35</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucially, she points out that “while the Rockefeller Foundation’s goal was to save on time and costs ministry employees spent making crop-related calculations manually, solutions and measures of success were aligned with political and business assumptions about the food crisis” <span class="citation" data-cites="allen_official_2019">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Allen 2019, 38</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Blank books and bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Before lumping them together, we should distinguish between bureaucracy (the state) and business (the corporation).</p>
<p>In her chapter on blank books, which can be seen as a document genre closely related to spreadsheets-as-documents, Lisa Gitelman notes that nineteenth-century job printed documents like blank books and forms shaped and served bureaucracies, businesses, and institutions – as she puts it, “the functional sites and institutions of daily life, among them settings like the marketplace, workplace, and municipality, as well as organizations like the company, the voluntary and trade association, the church, and the school” <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman_paper_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Gitelman 2014, 30</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>For Gitelman, the job printers who printed blanks “catered to bureaucracy, knowledge work of and for the state, but also of and for other residual and emerging forms of incorporation. Job printing fed the paperwork addiction of managerial capital, in particular, as it expanded into national and then multinational enterprises” <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman_paper_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Gitelman 2014, 24</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>“By dividing mental labor,” Gitelman writes, “blanks make bureaucracy, directing and delimiting fill-in entries that form the incremental expressions of the modern, bureaucratic self.” Blanks were one of “the elements of petty bureaucracy that form a systemic integument of sorts for the associated circulations of things, value, and people.” <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman_paper_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Gitelman 2014, 30</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.5</span> Census data</h2>
<p>U.S. census data is another example of tabular inventory that has a long paper history. Celin Boyd models census data as a “data assemblage.” Boyd selected the census to illustrate the idea of data assemblage because “tabular data is a common form of data as assemblage and because Census population statistics have societal power” <span class="citation" data-cites="boyd_data_2022">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Boyd 2022, 1342</a>)</span>. According to Boyd, “each assemblage is unique; its identity is formed and informed by its history, properties and the actions of its assemblers, who choose and arrange its components using a selection procedure” <span class="citation" data-cites="boyd_data_2022">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Boyd 2022, 1344</a>)</span>. Seen as part of this larger conglomeration of people, actions, and arrangements, the spreadsheet as tabular data collection is deeply linked to bureaucratic processes.</p>

<p>In a 2007 Dilbert cartoon, the character Asok approaches the boss to ask what he should do next. “Make a spreadsheet and track something,” says the boss. “Track what?” replies Asok. The boss: “I think you’ll find it doesn’t matter.”</p>

By writing something down and ordering it in a list – by describing it in an ordered fashion – that thing becomes legible and knowable. Tracking, accounting for, and control are at the heart of the bureaucratic enterprise, as the boss in <em>Dilbert</em> emptily parodies. As Hannah Turner notes regarding museum inventories, “specimens – supported by bureaucratic practices – became valuable precisely because of their records” <span class="citation" data-cites="turner_cataloguing_2020">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Turner 2020, 67</a>)</span>. As Turner relates, in museums of the 19th century, “[l]edger books provided a kind of bureaucratic power to achieve a system whereby objects could be retrieved and used as transportable objects of knowledge, where before they had been unsorted in storerooms of the museum” <span class="citation" data-cites="turner_cataloguing_2020">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Turner 2020, 85</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Lisa Gitelman writes, “because it implies accountability, knowing and showing together constitute an epistemic practice to which ethics and politics become available, even necessary…Knowing-showing, in short, can never be disentangled from power – or more properly, control” <span class="citation" data-cites="gitelman_paper_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Gitelman 2014, 5</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.7</span> Paper inventories</h2>
<p>Though she does not discuss them in her book, one example of the kind of blanks Gitelman describes in <em>Paper Knowledge</em> are <strong>spreadsheets-as-inventories</strong>. Spreadsheets both paper and digital have often been used in cultural heritage institutions like libraries, archives, and museums for non-financial uses: to make lists or inventories of objects and “scientific” observations.</p>
<p>In her book, <em>Cataloging Culture</em>, Hannah Turner traces the descriptive practices at the Smithsonian Museum’s anthropology department through documentation media over time. In the mid-19th century, information about ethnological objects sent to the museum “was recorded in what were variously called ‘recording books,’ ‘catalogue books,’ or ‘ledger books’…[t]hese large bound volumes, which contained spaces to make lists, are akin to many earlier forms of accounting documentation” <span class="citation" data-cites="turner_cataloguing_2020">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Turner 2020, 67</a>)</span>. According to Turner, the fields (aka column headings) in the books were borrowed and adapted from natural history collecting practice, and conventions for what fields were included shifted over time and may have inspired those used at other institutions.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">11</span> Bad spreadsheets: wrong uses and smelly errors</h1>
<p>Spreadsheets make people groan…sometimes audibly. Why does that happen? What is it about them that makes us judge them in the negative?</p>
<p>With an understanding of the material and interactive qualities of spreadsheets, their contexts and connotations both business, bureaucratic, and personal, we can begin to turn to their emotional and affective aspects. Despite the fact that filling out and interacting with a spreadsheet can cause a user to slip into a dehumanized mode, affect and emotion are part of the spreadsheet story. As we’ve already seen, the spreadsheet meanders into personal territory. Also, sometimes the bureaucratic machine falters and frustration emerges out of the fissures of failure. At other moments, we might find ourselves actually interested by a spreadsheet, or experiencing intense satisfaction from the process of interacting with it.</p>
<p>In their book <em>Failure</em>, Neta Alexander and Arjun Appadurai argue that “failure is not a self-evident property or quality of projects, institutions, technologies, or lives. Rather, it is a product of judgments that reflect various arrangements of power, competence, and equity in different places and times” <span class="citation" data-cites="alexander_failure_2020">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Alexander and Appadurai 2020, 1</a>)</span>. When a spreadsheet is perceived as bad or interesting, we turn away from the material qualities of spreadsheets and enter the territory of <em>judgment</em>.</p>
<p>The following sections look at the “badness” of spreadsheets (their inappropriateness, their errors, their failures, and their poor design) and how aesthetic judgments like “the interesting” and experiences of pleasure emerge from spreadsheet qualities and uses.</p>

<p>People have done spreadsheets wrong from the beginning. Spreadsheets have, since the days of Visicalc, been used for purposes they were not initially designed for. Even Dan Bricklin’s <em>mother</em> used them for reasons wholly unrelated to budgets or profit and loss statements. In the Planet Money episode “Spreadsheets!” <span class="citation" data-cites="jacob_goldstein_episode_2015">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2015</a>)</span>, Bricklin noted of Visicalc:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It let doctors do better calculations for anesthesiology before the their open-heart surgery. It was used by a company to decide where to put which slot machines on the casino floor. My mother, who was a principal of a middle school, she was using the spreadsheet to be able to keep track of who’s in what class and all. And it wasn’t until a couple of years later, she said, Daniel, do you know that it can do calculations? I said, Mom, I gave you demos.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.3</span> Complexity through accretion</h2>
<p>Randall Munroe’s “Algorithms” xkcd comic comments on just how absurdly and inefficiently complex spreadsheets can get, especially when shared and used over years. The comic places a “sprawling Excel spreadsheet built up over 20 years by a church group in Nebraska to coordinate their scheduling” at the extreme end of a scale showing algorithm complexity, far past algorithms powering self-driving cars and the Google search backend.</p>

<img data-src="assets/algorithms-1667.png" class="r-stretch quarto-figure-center"><p class="caption">xkcd algorithms</p><p>A post in the discussion section on the <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1667:_Algorithms">explainxkcd.com page for the “Algorithms” installment</a> captures anecdotes that corroborate the sentiment behind the humor of the comic. An anonymous user commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work in finance - reconciling 1 code takes half a GIGABYTE of spreadsheets every 4 weeks that had been added to and tweaked so many times in the last 5 years by 6 different people, 5 of which are no longer at the company (and the last one hasn’t used it in over a year) that it took me 4 months just to understand how the damned things worked and went together, and my work asks me to teach internal excel classes and run drop ins to help people out. First thing I did when I understood it was tear it down and rebuild from the ground up. Didn’t cut the number of sheets (actually ended up with more), but it now takes 3 days not 15 and has dropped from half a gig to about 270MB thanks to a major cleanup in the one file I kept.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.4</span> Spreadsheets are <em>not</em> for programming</h2>
<p>There is an idea that spreadsheets are so user-friendly and flexible that people will use them for anything, and this isn’t always seen as a good thing. “Spreadsheets,” installment 2180 of Randall Munroe’s webcomic xkcd, sums up this attitude that spreadsheets are not for <em>real</em> computer programming tasks. In the comic, an angel and a devil taunt and tempt Cueball, the main character, about using a spreadsheet. By the end, the angel has been seduced by the power of the QUERY() function. As another example, Excel is disparaged for being used for “inappropriate” tasks and for enabling shallow engagement with serious computational techniques. ExcelNet, presented at the satirical conference SIGBOVIK in 2016, creates a neural network in Excel. Authors David Fouhey and Daniel Maturana quip in their farcical white paper, “typically getting access to the power of Deep Learning requires hiring a nerd or learning obscure nerdy things. EXCELNET puts you in control, and lets anyone harness the power of Deep Learning!” <span class="citation" data-cites="fouhey_deep_nodate">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Fouhey and Maturana, n.d.</a>)</span> Though ExcelNet is a joke, as shown in a 1992 clip from the <em>Computer Chronicles</em>, a Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel add-in called Braincel actually <em>was</em> a serious product meant to allow users to create something akin to a neural network in a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Comedian Matt Parker’s satirical “Spreadsheet News Network” video reports on the UK government’s loss of positive COVID-19 test results due to the improper use of Excel. While details are fuzzy, Parker concludes that the UK’s Public Health England was using an Excel file format to store and share data. COVID-19 test results were first shared in CSV format, but then combined via an automated process, and exported as an .xls file. Since the number of test results exceeded the number of rows supported an .xls file (as opposed to an .xlsx file, which supports more rows), some results were cut out of the spreadsheet.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.10</span> Invisibility</h2>
<p>The difficulty with detecting and seeing spreadsheet errors demonstrate spreadsheet software’s potential for invisibility and occlusion or obfuscation. Paul Dourish points out that formulas are usually occluded or made invisible: “the spreadsheet is generally designed to mask—visually, at least—the distinction between direct nonbase objects, direct base objects, and derived objects” <span class="citation" data-cites="dourish_stuff_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Dourish 2017, 93</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In their 1994 paper, “Creating, comprehending and explaining spreadsheets: a cognitive interpretation of what discretionary users think of the spreadsheet model” D. G. Hendry and T. R. G. Green address comprehension as an aspect of spreadsheet use that involves understanding how the spreadsheet works. The authors conclude that computation is not always visible, and that some subjects in their study found it “difficult to predict how changes to one part of the spreadsheet will affect other parts” [<span class="citation" data-cites="hendry_creating_1994">Hendry and Green (<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">1994</a>)</span>, 1045). It can also be difficult to map the cell references to meaningful concepts in the domain modeled by the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>As an example, <a href="#/dibner-metadata-template">a metadata entry template</a> I created includes elaborate formulas, and their functioning is not readily apparent to a user. The workbook is used to gather metadata describing electronic theses and dissertations for a digitization project. If the user enters a title that matches data in a tab containing titles and authors extracted from ProQuest’s database, the worksheet pulls in cells from the database extract. Filters then populate subsets of the sheet into additional tabs, so CSV files can be exported and sent to different parties. On the surface, it can be difficult to tell which cells contain formulas; if a formula is accidentally deleted, or not copied to additional cells, the spreadsheet stops “working.”</p>

The authors borrow the idea of code smells from computer science (specifically Martin Fowler’s 199 book <em>Refactoring: improving the design of existing code</em>). Code smells are not errors or bugs per se, but rather potentially bad design choices. In order to help spreadsheet designers identify risks in the ways worksheets are structured and related to one another, the authors suggest that “inter-class” code smells could be used to categorize potential design issues with spreadsheets:</p>
<ul>
<li>inappropriate intimacy (“a worksheet that is overly related to a second worksheet”)</li>
<li>feature envy (“if there is a formula that is more interested in cells from another worksheet, it would be better to move the formula to that worksheet”)</li>
<li>middle man (for example, a formula that “contains only a reference to another cell and calculations, like the formula ‘=Sheet1!A2.’)</li>
<li>shotgun surgery (“a formula F that is referred to by many different formulas in different worksheets. By the same logic, the chances are high that many of the formulas that refer to F will have to be changed if F is changed”).</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.12</span> Spreadsheet errors</h2>
<p>In his “Spreadsheet News Network” video, comedian Matt Parker acknowledges the positives of using spreadsheets, defending his own use of them for purposes like plotting a graph using numbers he calculated using a Python script, responding “sometimes instead of finding and learning how to use a chisel, you turn to the hammer you’re already holding.”</p>
<p>With news of the bungled COVID-19 test results, however, he concludes that while spreadsheet software can be an easy to use and accessible choice for small data analysis and calculation, with life or death data, using Excel file formats was an example of “breathtaking incompetence.”</p>
<p>Parker solicits a comment (in formula format, naturally!) from European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group (EUSPRIG) chair Dr.&nbsp;Simon Thorne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>=IF(use = critical, “Formal Software Engineering Process”, IF(use = important, “Use a database”, “have fun with spreadsheets!”))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thorne’s comment essentially communicates that if the data is critical, one should use a formal software engineering process; if it’s important, it’s probably best to use a database; and if it’s not, go ahead and have fun with a spreadsheet. The parody ad in the video, “Spreadsheets may be for you!” makes a similar point about how spreadsheets are best for small data and not for critical data.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.13</span> Cryptic crypto errors as techno-failures</h2>
<p>Spreadsheet errors are often difficult to detect, whether they are the result of human data entry error, autocorrect, formulas with missing or erroneous components, or otherwise. In May 2021, an Australian couple received 10.47 million Australian dollars after “A worker in Bulgaria, who processed the refund, had entered the wrong numbers into an Excel spreadsheet, Michi Chan Fores, a Crypto.com compliance officer, told the court” <span class="citation" data-cites="press_couple_2022">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Press 2022</a>)</span>. The error wasn’t discovered until an audit was conducted in December of that year.</p>
<p>In their book <em>Failure</em>, Neta Alexander and Arjun Appadurai remark that “the Heideggerian attempt to bring together rupture and epistemology – the moment of failure and the production of knowledge – is put to the test in the age of digital and mobile technologies” <span class="citation" data-cites="alexander_failure_2020">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Alexander and Appadurai 2020, 26</a>)</span>. They note that while an object made of glass shatters violently, bringing attention to its fragile materiality, a smartphone “breaks down quietly and opaquely” <span class="citation" data-cites="alexander_failure_2020">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Alexander and Appadurai 2020, 26</a>)</span>. Drawing on the work of Frank Pasquale, Alexander and Appadurai argue that this “lack of transparency is the <em>raison d’être</em> of the ‘Black Box Society’” <span class="citation" data-cites="alexander_failure_2020">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Alexander and Appadurai 2020, 26</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>How do spreadsheets and their errors fit into this “Black Box Society”?</p>
<p>Some spreadsheet errors do not provide new knowledge of their inner workings: for example, why Excel autocorrects certain values is mysterious and it is difficult to change those settings. In this case, how the spreadsheet program itself functions remains opaque.</p>
<p>But other spreadsheet errors, once detected, do actually have the potential for debugging and the production of new knowledge about them. For example, a formula might be wrong (for example, a sum is taken instead of an average) or the data entered might be wrong (like the crypto error discussed earlier). These errors are quiet and hard to detect, since the output is often in an expected form (such as a number). However, once these errors are detected, the formulas and the data are there on the surface to be examined. While it might be painful to try to untangle someone else’s nest of formulas, it is possible to do so since they can be seen.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.7</span> Tabular frustrations</h2>
<p>Tabular data formats themselves present their own problems, and like spreadsheet software, they are often maligned.</p>
<p>First, there is little formal specification of these file formats in published standards, and what specification there is, is more recent. Dating from 1993 (according to the Wikipedia citation on the TSV page), the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/tab-separated-values">MIME type registration for TSV</a> remarks “doesn’t really need any, but here goes” before outlining a short definition. On the Library of Congress’ “Sustainability of Digital Formats” website, CSV is described as “A simple de facto format, for which no single, official specification exists” <span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_csv_2020">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick=""><span>“<span>CSV</span>, <span>Comma</span> <span>Separated</span> <span>Values</span> (<span>RFC</span> 4180)”</span> 2020</a>)</span>. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc4180">RFC 4180</a>, which describes a strict CSV implementation, was only published in 2005. More recent activity by the W3C attempts to specify <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/csvw/">CSV for the web</a>, including metadata, but it remains to be seen whether and how it will be adopted.</p>
<p>Though, as the Library of Congress “Sustainability of Digital Formats” website points out, “the simple nature of the CSV format allows easy programming for parsing and using the data,” this simplicity comes at a price. Critics take issue with the CSV’s lack of semantics and its inability to include metadata or type values. Alex Rasmussen <span class="citation" data-cites="rasmussen_its_2021">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2021</a>)</span>, in a piece titled “It’s Time to Retire the CSV,” points to variation of newline characters, delimiter escape characters, and other problems with the format.</p>
<p>The variability of delimiter-separated files is a real problem. In his blog post, “Want a DS project? There’s health insurance data out there,” Randy Au <span class="citation" data-cites="au_want_2022">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2022</a>)</span> writes about the process of parsing insurance company price data released as a result of the Transparency in Coverage rule from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which went into effect in July 2022. Astonished, Au shares that the data he downloaded from Humana, while labeled CSV, was in fact tilde (~) separated. While he was able to read the file, this example showcases the flexibility and lack of specification in tabular files.</p>

<p>Best practices and principles for formatting “good” data are generated in response to “bad” examples that often privilege the visual aspect of the spreadsheet over an interoperable tabular data format. But the spreadsheet’s visual formatting capabilities can be used to lay out information with human communication at the forefront, and cloud-based spreadsheets can be quickly shared and worked on collaboratively. A bilingual resource guide for undocumented immigrants, for example, uses bright colors to accentuate the grid and demarcate information, and it is shared via a public Google Sheets link.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.13</span> Maliciously bad data</h2>
<p>The sheer volume of the health insurance data released by insurance companies to comply with the Transparency in Coverage rule, coupled by the variety of formats and lack of documentation, could be understood as “malicious compliance,” to use Randy Au’s words. While Au concludes that the problem is more with how the data are structured and not malicious intent, it can be argued that the release of difficult to use data is an expression of power.</p>
<p>In their contribution entitled “Bad Data,” part of the Society of Cultural Anthropology’s Fieldsights series “Evil Infrastructures,” Britt S. Paris and Jennifer Pierre <span class="citation" data-cites="kelty_bad_2017">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2017</a>)</span> recount their community-engaged efforts to gather and sift through data on police homicides in LA county, begun in response to the lack of data on police killings in the wake of Michael Brown’s 2014 death.

<blockquote>
<p>ongoing, pervasive, and complex issues of power related to the U.S. government’s data collection and transparency efforts. The FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Report, for example, does not require every jurisdiction or even every state to report police homicides, and those that do comply do so on their own accord without any outside corroboration of their data.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">13</span> Spreadsheet aesthetics</h1>
<p>One way to explain the experience of using and making spreadsheets, and the ways they have permeated work and personal life, is to read the features and functions of spreadsheets, and their bureaucratic flavor, through the framework of aesthetic categories and judgments.</p>
<p>Though they might not be thought of as aesthetic objects, the experience of using, creating, or interacting with a spreadsheet invites aesthetic judgements. In her book <em>Our Aesthetic Categories: Zany, Cute, Interesting</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">2012</a>)</span>, Sianne Ngai defines aesthetic judgment as “a subjective, feeling-based evaluation” <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 112</a>)</span>. She traces the aesthetic category of the “interesting,” basing her analysis on the examples from German Romanticism’s interessante literature as defined by Friedrich Schlegel and others, as well as 20th century conceptual art and art criticism. According to Ngai, the interesting judgment is applied not only in “aesthetic” contexts; across contexts, it has a consistent function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ascribing value to that which seems to differ, in a yet-to-be-conceptualized way, from a general expectation or norm whose exact concept may itself be missing at the moment of judgment” <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 112</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> Pleasurable software</h2>
<p>While spreadsheets as documents can be interesting and boring, in contrast, as Wendy Chun explains, software produces a sense of pleasure, power, control, and mastery (perhaps a sense of all-knowing) by way of the computer’s production of a microworld. Part of the functioning of the microworld is its simulated visibility: “seeing his or her code produce visible and largely predictable results creates pleasure. One’s code causes an action to happen: cause and effect is clear, even if the end result is never entirely predictable” <span class="citation" data-cites="chun_software_2005">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Chun 2005, 39</a>)</span>. Thus, in counterpoint to the sense of not-knowing of the interesting, a different aesthetic judgment arises in the software microworld: pleasurable satisfaction.</p>
<p>Pleasure and satisfaction arise from the direct manipulation facilitated by the simulated visibility of software. Chun continues, “interactivity later became conflated with user freedom, and control with GUI (graphical user) and WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interfaces, which were seen as supplements to language-based commands. Unlike command-line interfaces, GUIs enabled “direct manipulation,” in which mastery was intimately linked to simulated visibility.” <span class="citation" data-cites="chun_software_2005">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Chun 2005, 40</a>)</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> Adrian Piper, Untitled</h2>
<p>Perhaps the piece of conceptual art that most directly evokes the electronic spreadsheet, Adrian Piper’s contribution to issue six of the magazine <em>0 to 9</em> takes the form of an empty table and also nods to the coordinate cell-referencing system of the electronic spreadsheet. The work consists of a listing of the coordinates of rectangles (cells) forming an empty grid of 12 columns by 31 rows. Piper’s system is “based on exhaustion of horizontal coordinates”.</p>

<img data-src="assets/piper.jpg" class="r-stretch quarto-figure-center"><p class="caption">Piper, Adrian. 1969. “Untitled.” <em>0 to 9</em>, no. 6 (July): 79-81</p><p>While Piper’s untitled contribution to <em>0 to 9</em> looks like a spreadsheet and is structured like one with its coordinate references, it is not actually this aspect of it that seems “interesting” in the sense Sianne Ngai outlines, but rather another aspect of her practice (and that of some of her contemporaries), which also invokes the spreadsheet: conceptual art’s emphasis on seriality and “algorithmic” methods. Piper’s contribution, with its enumeration of coordinates that result in a grid, is an example of a process of permutation and combination, as is Hanne Darboven’s adherence to counting and incrementation in the context of the calendar in <em>Century Book 00 - 99</em>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.3</span> Spreadsheets in conceptual art: Century Book 00 - 99</h2>
<p>There are examples of conceptual art (and earlier work) that activate the grid form in a way that gestures to the electronic spreadsheet or its antecedents, and invoke Ngai’s category of the interesting through their visual form on the page and through their focus on enumeration, comparison, and lists.</p>
<p>Several works included in the landmark 1970 MoMA exhibition <em>Information</em> evoke the spreadsheet. For example, Hanne Darboven’s <em>CENTURY BOOK 00 - 99</em> enumerates an index and creates a grid, part of her focus at the time on “the myriad permutations provided by the four to six digits needed to notate the day, month, and year of a standard Gregorian calendar date” <span class="citation" data-cites="rorimer_new_2001">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Rorimer 2001, 164</a>)</span> for the years within a century. The work consisted of “1 loose-leaf book containing photocopied images on paper, 5 drawings.” The drawings were “indices” of 42 page “books” which were presented in one binder. Four tables increment by one, beginning in the left column at the index of 1 and in the right column with an index of 0, between which appears. Following the tables are two grids (one consisting of two squares and one consisting of sixty one squares arranged in six rows of ten squares plus one lone square at the bottom), labeled 2K-61K.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.5</span> Typicality and the interesting in conceptual art</h2>
<p>As she traces the “interesting” category through time, Ngai notes how “in tandem with the intensification of its investment in knowledge, over the nineteenth century the interesting becomes increasingly associated with ‘the commonplace, the inessential, the accidental, the transient.’” <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 140</a>)</span>. As an example, she points to Susan Sontag’s concept of interesting photography, or the idea that everything can become interesting if photographed. For Ngai, Sontag’s ideas encapsulate a “shift in emphasis from difference to typicality”:</p>
<p>As exemplified in conceptual art, for Ngai the “interesting becomes an aesthetic of difference as information” <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 143</a>)</span>. According to Ngai, conceptual art turned away from pop and toward “an aesthetic of administrative and legal organization” <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 149</a>)</span>. Much conceptual “art mimics not just documentary evidence but paperwork” <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 145</a>)</span> in its visual forms, a resonance with the spreadsheet’s place in the genre of the document. As Ngai explains,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[i]n addition to mimicking art-specific strategies of disseminating information like the poster and the catalog, conceptual art became interested in all the ways and forms in which information might be displayed: telegrams, memos, <strong>spreadsheets</strong>, newspaper ads, specimen cases, list structures, notarized certificates, graphs, geological surveys, spectrometer analyses, card catalogs, surveillance reports.” <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 158</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Ngai lists the spreadsheet among other forms of information display, she does not include any examples of works that employ or mimic the spreadsheet form. Nonetheless, the spreadsheet exemplifies the quality of difference and the form of technologically mediated dissemination of information she describes. The inventory spreadsheet ties in directly to Ngai’s observations about the interesting as a category focused on typicality. With its paradigmatic activation of the spreadsheet grid in the form of the column, it invokes a reading of typicality across a group of described objects or observations.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.6</span> Surprise and difference</h2>
<p>While the pleasure and satisfaction of a narrative curve within the (spreadsheet) software’s microworld drifts from Ngai’s concept of the interesting, the interesting’s features of surprise and difference come into play in Brenda Laurel’s analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In human-computer interaction, like drama, surprise and reversal are efficient and economical means for achieving radical shifts in probability. The reasons for wanting to create such a shift may be pragmatic or aesthetic. A reversal may be needed to turn a person away from an unproductive or potentially dangerous path of action. Surprise and reversal can also be deployed to create changes in the “slope” of the action in order to achieve a pleasing whole. <span class="citation" data-cites="laurel_computers_2014">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Laurel 2014</a>, ch.&nbsp;3)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We return again to the spreadsheet’s ability to help us ask “what if,” a question that opens up the user to surprise through comparison.</p>

<section id="enumeration-and-fulfillment-boring-knowledge-work" class="slide level2 center" data-number="13.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.7</span> Enumeration and fulfillment: boring knowledge work</h2>
<p>As evoked in conceptual art, according to Ngai,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with its idioms of information, inventory, documentation, and research…the ‘cool,’ clean look of conceptual art was not just that of ‘thought’ but that of post-Fordist knowledge work. As Sol LeWitt commented in ‘Serial Project #1, 1966’: ‘The serial artist does not attempt to produce a beautiful or mysterious object but functions merely as a clerk cataloguing the results of his premise’ <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 145</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an enumeration and fulfillment of a system (both by adhering to the grid structure and whatever set of rules there might be for data entry), both the budget spreadsheet and the inventory spreadsheet employ a serial approach akin to conceptual, textual process works of Piper, Darboven, and others, as well as the photograph series and specimen collection pieces Ngai presents as examples. A museum inventory, for example, collects metadata about specimens which might be considered variations of a type or a theme. A budget spreadsheet or other numerically-forward spreadsheet makes use of formulas (the other key feature of the spreadsheet Paul Dourish identifies along with the grid) that cascade down rows or process data in multiple cells in order to produce a result.</p>
<p>The sense of exhaustiveness and repetition in these “scientific” forms of documentation (be they in a bureaucratic arm of the museum or in the works of art themselves) also invoke the boring, which Ngai argues is an inherent feature of the interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…the wavering between the boring and the interesting seems internal to the interesting…this affective uncertainty is clearly the source of the association of the interesting with ambivalence, coolness, or neutrality – affects not only associated with irony but with the modern scientific attitude <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 135</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, rather than the affective coolness of boringness, though, spreadsheets can be aggressively boring and evoke stronger aesthetic judgments.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.10</span> Severance: Lumon spreadsheets</h2>
<p>The emotional arc of spreadsheet use is invoked in an uncanny way in the Apple TV+ show <em>Severance</em>. The employees in the MacroData Refinement (MDR) department (who have had their work and personal consciousnesses severed via a medical procedure performed by their employer, Lumon Industries) spend their days “refining” data that appears on their computer terminals as a series of mysterious numbers arranged in a grid (without, however, the gridlines common to spreadsheet interfaces). The dark background with white text recalls the appearance of Visicalc and other spreadsheets of the 1980s, though rather than rely on keyboard commands, Lumon employees use a trackball embedded in their keyboards to select groups of numbers on the screen, which become larger when hovered over by the cursor.</p>

The Lumon spreadsheet also takes the feeling-based aesthetic judgment of the interesting/boring and pleasure/satisfaction and turns it on its head: the employees’ task is to group the numbers into one of five bins according to the feeling the numbers give them, yet the MDR employees are not privy to the purpose of their work or what the mysterious numbers on the screen mean. The spreadsheet, too, is severed: meaning resides elsewhere and is inaccessible to the user, who is somehow haunted by feelings.</p>

<p>While small changes in a spreadsheet can give rise to “interesting” effects that surprise and highlight difference – the “what-if” functionality mentioned earlier – on the flip side, invisible errors slip past the user/viewer and are difficult to detect. Spreadsheets are notorious for their errors: legendary horror stories abound about garbled gene sequence data and budget surpluses becoming deficits due to errors in formulas.</p>
<p>Ngai presents Richard Serra and Philip Glass’s <em>Long Beach Island, Word Location</em> as an example of conceptual art that highlights “dissonance between sensory experience and idea that their artwork describes.” <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 168</a>)</span>.

<p>While spreadsheets can very much be seen and it is their visual aspect that makes them seem accessible to users, as software they share an element of the invisible and inscrutable in common with conceptual art, although conceptual art seeks to expose the gap between the visible and the invisible, and spreadsheet software seeks to hide it. Spreadsheet errors are decidedly uninteresting in Ngai’s parlance, in the sense that they do not put “us in an affective relationship to the fact of our not knowing something” <span class="citation" data-cites="ngai_our_2012">(<a href="#/works-cited" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Ngai 2012, 165</a>)</span> since the user is not able to see what they don’t know.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">14</span> Concluding thoughts</h1>
<div style="font-size:.65em">
<p>However you’ve navigated and experienced this project, I hope it has made you think about spreadsheets from a new angle. Regardless of feelings negative or positive, it is clear that spreadsheets are used by a lot of people in a lot of different scenarios.</p>
<p>Spreadsheets are paradoxes. They often hold two extremes at once: they are both highly visual and thought of as containers for transporting and holding data; they are seen as intuitive, easy to use out-of-the-box and transparent, yet they are also highly complex and their deeper functions are obfuscated; they are malleable and can be used to do virtually anything, yet they are simplistic and limited and there are often better tools to accomplish the task at hand; they are rigidly gridded, yet flexible, merged cells or formatting obscuring the gridlines.</p>
<p>Spreadsheets also occupy many positions: they have powerful computational capabilities and the potential to create a manipulable data structure, but they are also an interface – a low-barrier point of contact for both creators and consumers of spreadsheets. At the same time, they are documents (though unlike their paper predecessors, they are more ephemeral and mutable).</p>
<p>Spreadsheets are often used to produce and view (tabular) data. Sometimes data that is stored in another format (like JSON or XML) is reshaped into tabular form so it can be shared with another system or person. While they may be understood to be for data, as numerous examples show, spreadsheet makers have long incorporated visual elements into their designs, or intended for them to be printed and shown to other people rather than fed into another computer program or script. There is thus a tension in spreadsheets between visual presentation and well-structured underlying data, between the visible and the invisible, between calculation/enumeration and communication.</p>
<p>Spreadsheets are not a neutral technology (neither the software nor the tabular format). Inattention to the values, design decisions, and multifarious uses of spreadsheets can breed unspoken assumptions about their neutrality. We need to study and understand spreadsheets better since they are part of the configuration of people and technologies producing, transforming, and moving around data. If they are one of the media through which data is communicated, we need to understand what features they bring to the table (forgive me for the pun!) and how people make use of those features in different contexts. Doing so can help us see that while sometimes spreadsheets are bad, boring, or wrong for the task, often they are interesting, satisfying, and accessible, allowing people to communicate and collaborate.</p>

<p>This project was completed to fulfill my MA in Interdisciplinary Studies from the XE: Experimental Humanities &amp; Social Engagement department at New York University. Huge thanks to my intrepid advisor and mentor, Professor Kimon Keramidas, for guiding me through the process. I’m grateful that I was able to develop ideas for this project in two courses: “Interdisciplinarity” with Professor Nadja Milner-Larsen and “Information Aesthetics” with Professor Leif Weatherby. Many thanks to María Matienzo for taking the time to chat with me and for her 2016 Code4Lib talk “Ever to Excel: Towards an Apologetics of the Spreadsheet,” which was what initially sparked my interest in spreadsheets. My gratitude also goes to my friend and colleague Karly Wildenhaus for generously sharing key sources with me, like Paul Dourish’s book <em>The Stuff of Bits</em>, and introducing me to spreadsheet channels on Are.na, which was the source of several of my spreadsheet examples and much inspiration.</p>
<p><em>Spreadsheets!</em> is built on Quarto, an open source framework for publishing in various formats using Markdown files and Pandoc. Via Quarto, I’ve used reveal.js, an open source framework for creating HTML slide decks (so yes, it looks like I’ve gone ahead and used the Powerpoint paradigm to represent the spreadsheet paradigm).</p>
